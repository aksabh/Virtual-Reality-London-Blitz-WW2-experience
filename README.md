MOTIVATION AND EXPLANATION OF PROJECT
Our project is the about the Blitz, a prolonged bombing attack on the United Kingdom by Germany during WWII. Specifically, we focused on the bombing of London that occurred between September of 1940 and May of 1941 [1]. We wanted to give users a realistic perspective on what the Blitz was actually like for those Londoners living through it, so our project teaches users about how the Blitz affected daily life.

We chose the London Blitz as the focus for our project because we felt that creating an experience of a  battlefront or war zone would be valuable to those who have never actually encountered such a threat in their daily lives. It would give them a new perspective of what it means to be at war.

SENSE OF PRESENCE
Intro

Our intro video was a segment about the London Blitz pulled from a WWII documentary. It increased sense of presence for our users by creating the context for what they were about to experience by explaining details about the Blitz: what London was like at the start of the Blitz, who was attacking London and why, and how the Blitz transformed a regular day into something far worse.

 

Experience

Our main feature to increase sense of presence during the experience was the audio present in the environment. We made use of actual radio recordings from the Blitz, speeches by Winston Churchill, air raid sirens, city noises, and plane FX to place the user in WWII London. We also populated the city with other people to provide more of a crowded feeling. Additionally, we incorporated British street decor, such as realistic London street signs and telephone boxes and accurate WWII British propaganda posters.

 

Outro

Our outro consisted of two parts: a short clip of Winston Churchill speech pulled from a WWII-based television show and a writing activity in which the user contrasted her life with that of someone who lived through the Blitz. The video increased sense of presence by providing a perspective of how the world and Great Britain reacted to the London Blitz. We also wanted to instill a sense of hope and motivation in the face of danger that the British citizens displayed during the Blitz, so we chose a speech by Churchill in which he was telling the British public that they would not surrender. Finally, for the writing activity, we chose to have the users contrast their lives with a Londonerâ€™s to make the Blitz experience more immediate. We hoped that in having to think about how their own lives would be affected by the Blitz, it would make the experience that more visceral.
